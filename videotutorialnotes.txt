eloquent object relational mapper (eloquent ORM)
you can also create raw sql query*
but eloquent will make it cleaner

example of inserting data to a table column
Use App\Name; (to call/bring the model file from app folder in to the controller)
$todo=new Name;
$todo->title='Some Name';
$todo->save();
(usually this is written in the controller)

blade template engine: control structures, this is where you put the html tags, php tags* so when saving a file save it with <filename>.blade.php
folder path: resources\views\layouts\app.blade.php
usually this will show up once you have entered:
php artisan make:auth

make pages controller~

{{config('page name','alternate name incase the name or title does not work')}}
