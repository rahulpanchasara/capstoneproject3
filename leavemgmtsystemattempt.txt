tables needed for a simple leave management system:
employees: include roles
employee accounts should include leave balance (24 paid leaves not including sick leave) for the whole year, if they had exceeded the balance the request will automatically be denied, but will only add up, 2 leaves per month, if not used will accumulate on the next month, can request for 2 additional leaves within the same month (4 vacation leaves)
so i must include a calendar*
approved/denied leaves per employee as determined by their leave balance
anyone can request for leave but only a limited number of requests can be approved
as determined on a first come first serve basis then the available leave balance an employee has
(automatic approval is optional?) scratch this part
employees can request 2 weeks before their intended leave
will be notified a week before the intended leave how? thru an email? try this

admin/s
add/edit/delete/deactivate employee profiles
see everyone's profile and their leave balances
deny, approve, cancel leave requests
send notification thru email..within the database or the site
admin does not have to request for a leave she uses a different leave request system

employees
edit password for the account
see leave balance for the current month
see tenure
	if tenure < 6 months, leave balance is only 20
	if tenure > 6 months, leave balance is 24
see who else had requested the leave on the same day including the time stamp
request for leave
cancel leave
request admin to cancel leave request
once request was cancelled the next in line will be granted the leave

statuses of the leave requests should be pending, approved, denied, cancelled
leave requests can only be cancelled one week before the actual leave date..if the date had past the employee can contact the admin to request to cancel the leave request

employee table
emp_name, email, password, role, leave_bal (int), emp_status

leave table
emp_id leave_date leave_stat time_stamp
